# Contributing to Golden-DevOps

Repo is currently only under my development, and I am not planning to work with some other contributors for more serious development, but I you want to contribute in some small functionality, add some not core feature, or fix something with repo feel free to fork this repo and do a Pull Request.

I recommended going to [Discussions](https://github.com/JakubSzuber/Golden-DevOps/discussions) or [Issues](https://github.com/JakubSzuber/Golden-DevOps/issues/new/choose) section in order to tell me about some tiny fixes, but if you want to collaborate with me for more serious development enhancement first contact me on [jszuber06@gmail.com](https://jszuber06@gmail.com) and I can add you as the repository's collaborator.

**Furthermore: a development branch with the prefix "dev_" is highly recommended.**
