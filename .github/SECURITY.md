## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using a public GitHub issue. If you believe you've found a security issue, please contact me through one of the following methods:
- https://github.com/JakubSzuber/Golden-DevOps/security/advisories
- https://huntr.dev/repos/JakubSzuber/Golden-DevOps
- Alternatively, through my mailing list: jszuber06@gmail.com

We do not currently have a bounty program in place, so we cannot offer monetary rewards for any reported problems.

You can claim bounty rewards by reporting vulnerabilities using Huntr: https://huntr.dev.

Whichever method you choose, you will be credited as the reporter once the announcement is published.
